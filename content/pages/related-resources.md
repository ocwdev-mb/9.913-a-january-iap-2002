The links below are online references for additional resources in the field of neuroanatomy. These range from professional societies that maintain links to areas that any reader can explore in this field. Many of the linked sites provide resources for further study, as well as downloadable resources that can be used for classroom teaching.

Neuroscience
------------

The [Society for Neuroscience](http://www.sfn.org/) addresses the study of brain development, sensation and perception, learning and memory, movement, sleep, stress, aging and neurological and psychiatric disorders. It also includes the molecules, cells and genes responsible for nervous system functioning.

The [International Brain Research Organization](http://ibro.info/) was founded to enhance the mobilization and utilization of the world's scientific resources for research on the brain.

The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/about/) (NIH) is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the United States, governed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The [American Academy of Neurology](http://www.aan.com/) provides valuable resources for medical specialists worldwide who are committed to improving the care of patients with neurological diseases.

The [American Clinical Neurophysiology Society](http://www.acns.org/) is a professional association dedicated to fostering excellence in clinical neurophysiology and furthering the understanding of central nervous system function in health and disease through education, research, and the provision of a forum for discussion and interaction.

The [National Neurotrauma Society](http://www.neurotrauma.org/) promotes neurotrauma research by enhancing communications, providing a forum, and increasing support on the national and international level.

Anatomy
-------

Annotated histology sections of developing mouse is a digital atlas of mouse development and a database resource for spatially mapped data such as _in situ_ gene expression and cell lineage.

The [3D Mouse atlas (MRI based)](http://www.emouseatlas.org/emap/home.html) site allows visitors to query cerebral structures of a 13.5 dpc mouse embryo and view 3-D reconstructions of those structures as well as reconstructions of the entire embryo.

[Cranial nerve tutorial](http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/h_n/cn/cn1/mainframe.htm). Fundamental information about the cranial nerves.

[Neuroanatomy online at University of Utah](http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/HISTHTML/NEURANAT/NEURANCA.html). This site contains interactive multimedia which allows the learner to move between diagrams, gross anatomy, microscopic specimens, definitions, and atlases in a manner tailored to the student's needs.

[Loyola University](http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Neuro/). Online neuroanatomy course information and content.

[Neuroanatomy and pathology on the Internet](http://web.archive.org/web/20071105111124/http://www.neuropat.dote.hu/) is a searchable directory compiled for medical students, residents, and other health professionals.

Online References

[The Human Brain](http://www.vh.org/Providers/Textbooks/BrainAnatomy/BrainAnatomy.html) is an online virtual hospital site hosted by the University of Iowa that provides a stunning array of images of the human central nervous system from infants to adults.

[The Whole Brain](http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html) atlas, hosted by the Harvard Medical School, displays pictures from MRI to fMRI in various disease states.
